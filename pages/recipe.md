# A recipe for success in image analysis

Follow these guidelines to maximize the success of your image analysis project.

### Make sure your project specifications are clear

To help you focus on the right things, you can download and use our template:

- **[Image analysis project sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NUFKOpXunjs9hOxmn5RvLNrfcF0DhXfgoVGIL3-eXiA/edit?usp=sharing)**

### Identify the right terminology for your problem

Finding keywords that match your problem will make it easier for you to review the literature and to communicate what you are trying to accomplish.

A good starting point:

- [State-of-the-Art tasks from Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/sota).

### Look for existing tools that might help

Search for software, libraries, or plugins that could help you solve your image analysis problem. 

Some places to check out:

- The [Image.sc](http://Image.sc) forum.
- For computer vision: [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/).
- Our curated list: [Software tools database](https://www.notion.so/Software-tools-af90da3522de4a34bc5246cc59c7efbf?pvs=21).

### Identify the simplest possible approach that might work and try it first

Sometimes, simple approaches are good enough. If not, the performance of simple algorithms will at least give you a baseline for comparison.

An interesting seminar:

### T**rack your progress and conclude when the results are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù**

Developing a functional image analysis solution can be a lot of work. Celebrate each small incremental achievement that you make!

### **Seek feedback from others**

Make sure that there are people around you who understand what you are working on and are available to give you feedback, suggestions, and advice.
